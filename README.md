# methodOfCharacteristicsFor1DShockTube
This GitHub repository contain course assignment for Unsteady Aerodynamics (AE51005) offered at IIT Kharagpupr. The assignment focused on the calculation of parameters in different zones of a one-dimensional shock tube. The repository includes code written in Python to compute the flow parameter in expansion fan using the method of characteristics.

The calculation of flow parameters in differen zone is included in the assignment jupyternotebook(assignment.ipynb).
